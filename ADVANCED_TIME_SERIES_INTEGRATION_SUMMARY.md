- **Features**:
  - Multiple distance metrics (DTW, Euclidean, Manhattan)
  - Configurable top-k retrieval
  - Metadata filtering support

### 3. Advanced Pattern Detector
- **Location**: `src/wavelet_analysis/advanced_pattern_detector.py`
- **Purpose**: Enhanced pattern detection combining wavelets with SAX and shapelets
- **Features**:
  - Shapelet extraction for discriminative pattern discovery
  - Pattern motif extraction
  - Pattern transition probability analysis
  - Multi-method pattern classification

### 4. Enhanced Pattern Comparison Tool

   - Enhanced pattern comparison capabilities

2. **New Callback**: `update_advanced_pattern_analysis`
   - Performs advanced pattern analysis with SAX
   - Discovers pattern motifs
   - Calculates transition probabilities
   - Creates comprehensive analysis visualizations

### Key Features in Dashboard

1. **Pattern Motif Discovery**:
   - Automatically discovers recurring SAX patterns
   - Groups patterns by type
   - Shows frequency and examples

2. **Pattern Transition Analysis**:
   - Calculates transition probabilities between pattern types
   - Helps predict likely pattern sequences
   - Useful for forecasting

3. **Advanced Visualization**:
   - SAX distance matrices
   - Pattern clustering with PCA
   - Wavelet strength analysis
   - Feature importance charts

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize advanced detector
detector = AdvancedWaveletPatternDetector()

# Detect patterns with advanced features
results = detector.detect_patterns_advanced(
    data_df, 
    price_col='close',
    extract_motifs=True
)

# Access results
patterns = results['patterns']      # Enhanced with SAX
motifs = results['motifs']         # Recurring patterns
transitions = results['transitions'] # Pattern transitions
clusters = results['clusters']      # Pattern groups
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Pattern Recognition**:
   - SAX provides robust symbolic representation
   - Handles noise and minor variations better
   - Enables string-based pattern matching

2. **Faster Pattern Search**:
   - Similarity search indexes patterns for quick retrieval
   - Supports multiple distance metrics
   - Scales to large pattern databases

3. **Better Pattern Understanding**:
   - Motif discovery reveals recurring behaviors
   - Transition analysis shows pattern sequences
   - Clustering groups similar patterns

4. **Enhanced Forecasting**:
   - Pattern transitions help predict next patterns
   - Motifs indicate stable market behaviors
   - Similarity search finds historical analogues

## Future Enhancements

1. **MultiRocket Integration**:
   - Framework is ready for MultiRocket features
   - Can add rocket features for ultra-fast classification
   - Placeholder for future implementation

2. **HIVECOTEV2 Support**:
   - Structure supports ensemble methods
   - Can integrate HIVECOTEV2 when needed
   - Placeholder for advanced classification

3. **Real-time Pattern Streaming**:
   - SAX enables efficient streaming analysis
   - Can process patterns as they occur
   - Foundation for real-time alerts

## Technical Details

### SAX Configuration
- Default: 20 segments, 5-letter alphabet
- Adjustable based on data characteristics
- Balances detail vs. generalization

### Similarity Search
- Default: DTW distance metric
- Top-5 similar patterns retrieved
- Supports custom filtering

### Pattern Storage
- Patterns enhanced with SAX strings
- Indexed for fast retrieval
- Metadata preserved for analysis

## Performance Considerations

1. **SAX Transformation**: O(n) complexity
2. **Similarity Search**: O(n log n) with indexing
3. **Motif Discovery**: O(nÂ²) worst case, optimized with SAX
4. **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead with string representations

## Conclusion

The integration of advanced time series techniques significantly enhances the financial wavelet prediction system's capabilities. SAX provides robust pattern representation, similarity search enables fast pattern retrieval, and the enhanced analysis tools provide deeper insights into market behaviors. The system is now better equipped to handle real-world financial data with improved pattern recognition and forecasting capabilities.
