# Sprint 4: Feature Engineering - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline for financial time series prediction, combining pattern-based features from wavelets and DTW with traditional technical indicators and transition matrices.

## Completed Components

### 1. Pattern Feature Extractor (`src/features/pattern_feature_extractor.py`)
- **Wavelet Features**: Extracts features from wavelet coefficients (mean, std, energy, entropy)
- **DTW Similarity Features**: Computes distances to reference patterns
- **Cluster Features**: Assigns patterns to clusters and extracts cluster-based metrics
- **Temporal Features**: Captures time-based patterns and trends
- Successfully extracts 26 pattern features from time series windows

### 2. Technical Indicators (`src/features/technical_indicators.py`)
- **Trend Indicators**: SMA, EMA, MACD, ADX
- **Momentum Indicators**: RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R, ROC
- **Volatility Indicators**: Bollinger Bands, ATR, Standard Deviation
- **Volume Indicators**: OBV, CMF, VWAP, MFI
- **Custom Indicators**: Support for user-defined indicators
- Computes 56 technical indicators with proper handling of edge cases

### 3. Transition Matrix Builder (`src/features/transition_matrix.py`)
- **Multi-order Transitions**: Builds transition matrices up to specified order
- **Conditional Transitions**: Captures transitions under different market conditions
- **Entropy Features**: Extracts pattern entropy and transition entropy
- **Stability Features**: Detects cycles and pattern stability metrics
- Generates 18 transition-based features from pattern sequences

### 4. Feature Pipeline (`src/features/feature_pipeline.py`)
- **Unified Pipeline**: Combines all feature extraction methods
- **Automatic Scaling**: StandardScaler, RobustScaler, or MinMaxScaler
- **Missing Value Handling**: Imputation strategies (mean, median, drop)
- **Target Creation**: Supports both classification and regression targets
- **Persistence**: Save/load functionality for fitted pipelines
- Processes 113 total features from multiple sources

### 5. Feature Selector (`src/features/feature_selector.py`)
- **Multiple Selection Methods**: Mutual information, F-test, Lasso, Random Forest, RFE
- **Correlation Filtering**: Removes highly correlated features (>0.95)
- **Importance Analysis**: Comprehensive feature importance scoring
- **SHAP Integration**: Support for SHAP value analysis
- **Visualization**: Feature importance plots and correlation heatmaps
- Reduces features from 113 to 20 most important

## Key Results

### Feature Distribution
- **Technical Indicators**: 56 features covering trend, momentum, volatility, and volume
- **Pattern Features**: 26 features from wavelets, DTW, and clustering
- **Transition Features**: 18 features from pattern transition analysis
- **Price Features**: 13 features from returns and price positions
- **Time Features**: Additional cyclical and calendar features

### Feature Selection Results
- **Top Features Identified**:
  1. `price_position_20d` (1.000) - Price position in 20-day range
  2. `macd_histogram` (0.801) - MACD histogram values
  3. `roc_10` (0.737) - 10-day rate of change
  4. `rsi_21` (0.699) - 21-day RSI
  5. `returns_20d` (0.617) - 20-day returns

- **Feature Reduction**: 82.3% reduction (113 → 20 features)
- **Correlation Handling**: Removed redundant features with >0.95 correlation

### Performance Characteristics
- **Extraction Speed**: ~10 seconds for 1000 samples with all features
- **Memory Efficiency**: Sparse matrix usage for transition matrices
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets with batch processing

## Generated Artifacts

- `data/processed/all_features.csv` - Complete feature matrix (1000×113)
- `data/processed/selected_features.csv` - Selected features (1000×20)
- `data/processed/feature_importance.csv` - Feature importance scores
- `data/processed/pipeline_config.json` - Pipeline configuration

### Visualizations
