## Usage Examples

### Basic Backtest
```python
from src.evaluation.backtest_engine import BacktestEngine, BacktestConfig

config = BacktestConfig(
    initial_capital=100000,
    position_size=0.1,
    commission=0.001
)

engine = BacktestEngine(config)
results = engine.run_backtest(data, predictions, signal_generator)
```

### Risk Analysis
```python
from src.evaluation.risk_analyzer import RiskAnalyzer

analyzer = RiskAnalyzer()
metrics = analyzer.analyze(returns, trades)
stress_results = analyzer.stress_test(returns)
```

### Performance Reporting
```python
from src.evaluation.performance_reporter import PerformanceReporter

reporter = PerformanceReporter()
report = reporter.generate_report(results, "MyStrategy")
reporter.generate_tearsheet(report, "MyStrategy")
```

## Key Insights

### Backtesting Best Practices
1. **Realistic Costs**: Include all transaction costs
2. **Walk-Forward**: Always validate out-of-sample
3. **Regime Awareness**: Performance varies by market condition
4. **Risk Management**: Stop-losses and position sizing crucial
5. **Multiple Metrics**: Don't rely on single metric

### Performance Considerations
- Transaction costs significantly impact returns
- Market regime changes affect strategy performance
- Risk-adjusted returns more important than raw returns
- Consistency across time periods indicates robustness

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Live Trading Integration**
   - Real-time data feeds
   - Broker API connections
   - Order execution system

2. **Advanced Risk Management**
   - Portfolio optimization
   - Dynamic hedging
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Online learning for adaptation
   - Reinforcement learning for trading
   - Feature importance tracking

4. **Reporting Enhancements**
   - Real-time dashboards
   - Mobile app integration
   - Alert systems

## Conclusion

Sprint 6 successfully delivered a professional-grade evaluation and backtesting framework. The system provides:

- **Realistic Backtesting**: With comprehensive transaction cost modeling
- **Risk Analysis**: Complete suite of risk metrics and stress testing
- **Market Awareness**: Regime-based performance analysis
- **Professional Reporting**: Publication-ready reports and visualizations
- **Robustness Testing**: Walk-forward validation for out-of-sample performance
