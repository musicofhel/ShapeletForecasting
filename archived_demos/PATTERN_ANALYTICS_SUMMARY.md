#### Pattern Correlation Matrix
```python
create_pattern_correlation_matrix(patterns: pd.DataFrame) -> go.Figure
```

- Shows which patterns tend to occur together

#### Risk Metrics Dashboard
```python
create_risk_metrics_dashboard(patterns: pd.DataFrame) -> go.Figure
```
- Risk-return scatter plot

## Usage Example

```python
from src.dashboard.visualizations.analytics import PatternAnalytics

# Initialize analytics
analytics = PatternAnalytics()

# Load pattern data
patterns = pd.DataFrame({
    'pattern_id': ['PAT_001', 'PAT_002', ...],
    'timestamp': [...],
    'ticker': ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', ...],
    'pattern_type': ['double_top', 'triangle', ...],
    'quality_score': [0.85, 0.72, ...],
    'current_price': [150.25, 2800.50, ...],
    'prediction': [0.02, -0.01, ...],  # Optional
    'actual_return': [0.015, -0.008, ...],  # Optional
    'volatility': [0.02, 0.03, ...]
})

# Generate comprehensive report
report = analytics.generate_analytics_report(patterns)

# Create all visualizations
dashboard = analytics.create_comprehensive_dashboard(patterns)

# Access individual analyses
freq_analysis = analytics.analyze_pattern_frequency(patterns)
quality_analysis = analytics.analyze_pattern_quality(patterns)
risk_metrics = analytics.calculate_risk_metrics(patterns)
signals = analytics.generate_trading_signals(patterns)
```
