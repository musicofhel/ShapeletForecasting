# Pattern Feature Extraction System - Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive feature extraction system for wavelet patterns that extracts key characteristics including energy, duration, amplitude, shape descriptors, and frequency content. The system is designed for high-performance pattern analysis with feature extraction completing in under 10ms per pattern.

## Key Components

### 1. PatternFeatures Dataclass

## Usage Examples

### Basic Feature Extraction
```python
from src.dashboard.pattern_features import PatternFeatureExtractor

# Initialize extractor
extractor = PatternFeatureExtractor(wavelet='db4', normalize=True)

# Extract features from a pattern
features = extractor.extract_features(pattern)
feature_vector = features.to_vector()
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Extract features from multiple patterns
patterns = [pattern1, pattern2, pattern3]
feature_matrix = extractor.extract_batch(patterns)
```

### Similarity Calculation
```python
# Calculate similarity between patterns
similarity = extractor.calculate_similarity(pattern1, pattern2, metric='cosine')
```

### Fast Extraction
```python
# Extract only selected features
selected = ['dominant_frequency', 'amplitude_max', 'energy_concentration']
fast_extractor = FastPatternFeatureExtractor(selected_features=selected)
features = fast_extractor.extract_features_fast(pattern)
```
