## Missing Feature: Pattern Type Classification System

You're absolutely right! The current system is missing a crucial component for identifying and classifying specific pattern types. We need to add:

### **NEW: Pattern Type Classification System**
- [x] **Create Pattern Type Classifier**
  - [x] src/dashboard/pattern_classifier.py
  - [x] tests/test_pattern_classifier.py
  - [x] Traditional pattern recognition (Head & Shoulders, Triangles, Flags, etc.)
  - [x] Shapelet/motif discovery and classification
  - [x] Fractal pattern identification
  - [x] Custom pattern definition interface
  - [x] Pattern naming and labeling system
  - [x] Pattern confidence scoring

- [x] **Pattern Library Management**
  - [x] src/dashboard/pattern_classifier.py (integrated)
  - [x] Predefined pattern templates
  - [x] User-defined pattern storage
  - [x] Pattern metadata (frequency, reliability, profitability)
  - [ ] Pattern evolution tracking
  - [ ] Cross-market pattern validation

This would replace the generic "Pattern A, Pattern B" labels with meaningful classifications like:
- "Head and Shoulders"
- "Ascending Triangle"
- "Bull Flag"
- "Double Bottom"
- "Fractal Pattern #3"
- "Custom Shapelet: Market Reversal"
- etc.
