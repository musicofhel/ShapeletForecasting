# Financial Wavelet Prediction MVP - Summary

## Overview
This MVP provides a comprehensive financial analysis dashboard that combines:
- Real-time market data from Yahoo Finance
- Wavelet decomposition for signal analysis
- Pattern detection and classification
- Predictive modeling
- Backtesting capabilities

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Data Integration**
- Uses `yfinance` for live market data
- Robust rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- SQLite database caching for efficiency
- Handles connection failures gracefully

### 2. **Wavelet Analysis**
- Multi-level wavelet decomposition
- Support for various wavelet types (db4, db6, sym4, coif2, bior2.4)
- Energy distribution visualization
- Component reconstruction

### 3. **Pattern Detection**
- Automatic pattern recognition
- Classification of common chart patterns:
  - Head and shoulders
  - Double tops/bottoms
  - Triangles (ascending/descending)
  - Flags and wedges
- Confidence scoring for each pattern

### 4. **Prediction System**
- Pattern-based forecasting
- Confidence intervals
- Multiple prediction horizons
- Visual prediction overlays

### 5. **Backtesting Engine**
- Strategy performance evaluation
- Key metrics: Sharpe ratio, win rate, total return
- Equity curve visualization
- Trade signal markers

## Running the MVP

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly pywt yfinance
```

### Launch the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run mvp_demo.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage Guide

### 1. **Overview Mode**
- View real-time price data
- See wavelet decomposition
- Monitor basic statistics

### 2. **Pattern Detection Mode**
- Click "Detect Patterns" to find patterns
- View pattern overlays on price chart
- See pattern statistics and distribution

### 3. **Prediction Mode**
- Select a detected pattern
- Choose prediction horizon
- Generate forecast with confidence bands

### 4. **Backtesting Mode**
- Select backtest period
- Run strategy simulation
- View performance metrics and trade signals

## Troubleshooting

### YFinance Connection Issues
If you see "Failed to get data" errors:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Wait a few minutes (rate limiting)
3. Try a different ticker
4. The app will use cached data if available

### Performance
- The MVP uses caching to improve performance
- First load may be slower as data is downloaded
- Subsequent loads use cached data

## Limitations
- Predictions are simplified for MVP
- Real trading should use more sophisticated models
- Backtest results are illustrative only

## Next Steps
1. Add more sophisticated prediction models
2. Implement real-time streaming
3. Add portfolio management features
4. Enhance pattern recognition accuracy
5. Add more technical indicators
