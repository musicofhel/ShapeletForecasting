    - Low Volatility Bull
    - High Volatility Bear
    - Sideways Market
    - Volatile Transition
  - Regime transition matrix calculation
  - Persistence analysis for each regime
  - Feature engineering for regime detection

### 6. PerformanceReporter (`src/evaluation/performance_reporter.py`)
- **Report Generation:**
  - Individual strategy performance reports
  - Multi-strategy comparison tables
  - Visualization of key metrics
  - HTML report generation with charts
  - CSV export for further analysis

## Demonstration Results

### Backtest Engine Performance
```
Initial Capital: $100,000
Example Results:
- Total Return: -9.69% to +19.88%
- Sharpe Ratio: -0.60 to +0.63
- Max Drawdown: 7.88% to 16.32%
- Win Rate: 20.25% to 41.18%
```

### Walk-Forward Analysis
```
Windows Tested: 16
Average Return per Window: 0.07% to 0.25%
Return Consistency: 43.8% to 62.5%
Average Sharpe: -0.75 to -0.47
```

### Risk Analysis
```
Stress Test Results:
- Market Crash: +1.14% return, 33.18% drawdown
- Flash Crash: +13.79% return, 24.82% drawdown
- Volatility Spike: +56.12% return, 47.59% drawdown
- Correlation Breakdown: -30.21% return, 36.54% drawdown
- Black Swan: -11.50% return, 41.53% drawdown
```

### Market Regime Analysis
```
Regime Distribution:
- Low Volatility Bull: 27.9% of time
- High Volatility Bear: 24.0% of time
- Sideways Market: 22.9% of time
- Volatile Transition: 25.1% of time

Average Regime Duration:
- Bull Market: 109 days
- Sideways: 2.6 days
- Volatile: 2.8 days
```

## Key Achievements

1. **Realistic Backtesting**: Implemented comprehensive backtesting with all real-world considerations including transaction costs, slippage, and position limits.

2. **Robust Validation**: Walk-forward analysis ensures out-of-sample performance validation and prevents overfitting.

3. **Risk Management**: Complete risk analysis framework with stress testing for various market scenarios.

4. **Market Awareness**: Regime detection allows strategies to adapt to changing market conditions.

5. **Professional Reporting**: Automated report generation for strategy evaluation and comparison.

## Integration Points

The evaluation framework integrates seamlessly with:
- Model predictions from Sprint 5
- Feature engineering from Sprint 4
- Pattern analysis from Sprint 3
- Wavelet decomposition from Sprint 2

## Usage Example

```python
# Configure backtest
config = BacktestConfig(
    initial_capital=100000,
    position_size=0.1,
    commission=0.001,
    slippage=0.0005,
    stop_loss=0.02,
    take_profit=0.05
)

# Run backtest
engine = BacktestEngine(config)
results = engine.run_backtest(data, predictions, signal_generator)

# Analyze risk
analyzer = RiskAnalyzer()
metrics = analyzer.analyze(returns, trades)

# Generate report
reporter = PerformanceReporter()
report = reporter.generate_report(results, "my_strategy")
```
